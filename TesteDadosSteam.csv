Game is posing a question what if? What if Tianxian Empire was able to colonize Siberia before Russia did and later had started war to extend its ownership over the rest of Europe and America? Players acting for the 3 of the world superpowers - Britain, Tianxia and the Holy Roman Empires have teams of up to 8 units equipped with guns and machinery of the times of WWI in order to complete 30 tactical missions. For instance, you can be asked to capture an area, defend a lodgement or a person, attempt to sabotage, etc. To succeed in the game, players must: Equip their teams according to the chosen strategy - select the right units, ammunition and armory for the mission; Read mission tactical maps; Lead units in the smart way and accurately - they are so easily killed and you have only few of them; Key Features Realisticity and complexity - actions in the game are driven by solid physic based combat mechanics and this is what it makes to be similar to the classics of table games - Warhammer, Infinity the Game; Possibility to use its own and take over enemy equipment - tanks, cannons and mortars; Possibility to equip units according to the tasks of the missions and your preferences; Original weaponry that is similar to the one used during the times of Great War; Battlecam with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling; Beautiful settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself; Nice little perks like - destroyable environment, interactive fauna and melee weapons; We sincerely want you to enjoy Steam Squad as we tried hard to make it interesting.

It’s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost. Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists. Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine. Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly. Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis. Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you’re clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts. Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds: Summon new worlds with a push of a button. Experience tons of untamed space rocks, then suffocate to death in them!","['English', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Korean', 'Russian']","['English', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Korean', 'Russian']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/header_alt_assets_6.jpg?t=1654189805","https://www.kleientertainment.com/games/oxygen-not-included","","livesupport@kleientertainment.com",True,True,True,86,"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/oxygen-not-included?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f",0,82902,3014,"",45,80467,"",3574,1441,1003,2777,"Klei Entertainment","Klei Entertainment","Single-player,Steam Trading Cards","Indie,Simulation","Colony Sim,Base-Building,Survival,Resource Management,Building,Singleplayer,Management,Simulation,2D,Sandbox,Strategy,Space,Indie,Sci-fi,Exploration,Open World,Difficult,Adventure,Early Access,Multiplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/ss_78d1c92edeecc7b17cafa9248867fe7d4390a0a0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654189805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/ss_67ab224dd8c781d5a27ee52657173298873d439a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654189805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/ss_ba2b8c362327add29b08182d13b04bf502e065cd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654189805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/ss_c5e20abaf2c82f9156da9c80b2ec7c0aefc46254.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654189805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/ss_24a4ffeaf41ea6d782fef203177243d36c185506.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654189805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/ss_02af9f36ca186bba1d0f2d5819d169e741076b46.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654189805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/ss_a481601e529d5fd3acc25a55557dfd1775cc6c96.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654189805,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/457140/ss_936e1756325dbd936f5b5227bdfb3357b57b356c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1654189805","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256757654/movie_max.mp4?t=1564503300,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256732663/movie_max.mp4?t=1540515738,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256685295/movie_max.mp4?t=1495142922,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256719917/movie_max.mp4?t=1528996831,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708317/movie_max.mp4?t=1518112971,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256701212/movie_max.mp4?t=1510854853,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256693600/movie_max.mp4?t=1503595564,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256665154/movie_max.mp4?t=1465840964"

695420,"Hex: Origins","Sep 23, 2017","0 - 20000",0,0,1.99,0,"Hex: Origins is a casual puzzle game based on a complete hexagon themed colorful experience. Enjoy a refreshing, calming and original experience, which is extremely easy to pick up but hard to master as you progress in the game. Across the multitude of game modes and levels you will encounter, you must place pieces composed of anywhere from 2 to 10 and more hexagons, each using up to 6 different colors. Everything in the game is based on two simple rules: You can place a piece anywhere on the board with no restrictions as long as all the neighboring tiles are empty. If one hex has a colored neighbor on the board, at least one of those neighbors needs to match its color. Building upon these simple rules, we added special board pieces and power-ups in order to create a fun and colorful experience. As long as you keep placing pieces on the board, its requirements for placing pieces change - so be careful about the order, colors and type of shapes you can use. Always plan ahead! Gameplay Hex: Origins offers you 4 different game modes, 2 available from the start, and 2 unlocked with tokens you earn while playing the game: Classic: a linear experience bundled up in Episodes, structured into 6 Chapters, each containing 6 Levels that you can play in 3 difficulties. Each Episode introduces new mechanics into gameplay and with each passing chapter, the difficulty is slightly raised - but so are the rewards! Flow: a linear experience similar to Classic, with the added requirement of connecting various battery pieces to light bulbs in order to power them up! Carefully plan your colored ways across the board and take up the challenge! Don't forget to fill up the board, though. Exploration: Give up the static board and expand in any direction! Exploration maps feature a center starting point with all the colors onto which you will start expanding in any direction you want. Treasure Hunting: On rare occasions you will find treasure map fragments. Assemble them into a map and embark on a  thematic journey in order to find the hidden treasures of Hex: Origins. Always remember that X marks the spot! Features Over 800 levels of ever-increasing challenges with 3 difficulty options Dynamic level difficulty &amp; no unique solutions: the moves you make always alter the possible shapes that can be placed thus making it easier or harder for yourself. As you place these pieces the game will try to generate pieces that you can use. Plan ahead carefully. Finish a level in any way possible! Shuffle mechanic: discard existing pieces and draw new ones in exchange for a tiny fraction of your progress bar. 5 power-ups that you can use to slightly alter or completely change the game board. Special bonus shapes: from time to time a difficult to place piece will appear (9+ hex piece). Place it on the board and successfully finish the level and earn extra rewards. Complete in-game quests that range from easy to hard and get awesome rewards! Open treasure chests and reap the rewards while you complete any level! Unlock custom hex piece skins. Customize your board with that extra bling! Customize the game experience with 9 beautiful backgrounds! Cloud saving, achievements, stats, leaderboards, level editor, workshop and soon trading cards!","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Romanian', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Romanian', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/695420/header.jpg?t=1506349129","http://www.prettybatgames.com","","support@prettybatgames.com",True,True,True,0,"",0,8,0,"",19,0,"",0,0,0,0,"Pretty Bat Games","Pretty Bat Games","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud,Stats,Steam Leaderboards,Includes level editor","Casual,Indie","Indie,Casual,Puzzle,Relaxing,Hex Grid","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/695420/ss_88a2d562f3cfb51c39a6d7da5e125647e7f6e0a6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506349129,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/695420/ss_29a7f4cace17983f0d24e24c9d21d9187c21705e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506349129,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/695420/ss_e68c06dba41ddf880de3b08cb7570c442fdc77df.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506349129,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/695420/ss_e435d58d88188756f53c2e690e88c60cdd4893c7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506349129,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/695420/ss_a6f9877114ad5863c3a42ec6b4b0e789e25bda7e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1506349129","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256696474/movie_max.mp4?t=1506349123,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256692410/movie_max.mp4?t=1504948567,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256696408/movie_max.mp4?t=1506287071"
